and it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task , but what i &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that i think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
and those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and i &apos;m going to start with this one : if momma ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
we know that , right ? we &apos;ve experienced that .
and if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
that &apos;s the theme of my talk .
and we &apos;re making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
